pg800 is a GTK+ midi editor for the Roland MKS-70 Super JX analog
synthesizer.
It can send a single tone parameter or a complete tone.
Tones can be saved to an XML file, one tone for file.
Now it can also load a complete SysEx MIDI Bulk Dump, one tone
at a time from a list of the 50 tones in the dump.

This program has only been tested on GNU/Linux, but it may work
on other systems where all the required libraries are installed.

To build from git repository you need the following packages:

GNU Autotools
libgtkmm30
rtmidi
boost
libxml++
inkscape (to generate the icons)

Of course you need the devel (dev) packages of the libraries.

First run autogen.sh to generate the files.
Then run configure, make and make install to build and
install the program. You may need to be root to install
in system directories. This program can be run from
the source directory without installation.

To build from tarballs you don't need GNU Autotools, nor
inkscape, but you still need the development packages
of the libraries.
